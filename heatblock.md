# Heatblock

The heatblocks on AliExpress normally come in brass, nickel-plated copper, and aluminum. Copper offers the best thermal conductivity of all of them which makes it the better option.

## How to use a M6 Nozzle instead of MK8

The threading for both the MK8 and the M6 is the same although the M6 may be taller in height. An issue you might run into while using an M6 silicone sock is a poor fit. An MK10 Silicone sock might fit better than the stock MK8 sock for a M6 nozzle (*needs confirmation*).

## Changing Nozzles

There are many guides on Youtube for this, however, the following points are crucial:

1. Heat the heatblock *above* your normal printing temperature. Example, if the hottest material you print is PETG, printed at 245C, heat the heatblock to 260C at the very least.
2. You tighted the nozzle against the heatbreak, *not* the heatblock. That means that when your nozzle is tightened, there will be a very clear gap between the nozzle and the heatblock.

3. Do not overtighted because you will stripe the threads or break the nozzle. A [torque wrench](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4738816) is highly recommended; you want roughly 1.5N*m of torque..
