## Hotend

### PCB SV06ZJB_V1.4

<img src="./images/hotend-pcb-labelled.png" width="800" alt='Hotend PCB'/>

| Label | Connection | PCB Connection | Other Connection | Other info |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| P3 | Coldend fan | JST 1.25mm 2-Pin |  |  |
| P2 | Extruder motor | JST 1.25mm 4-Pin | JST PH 2.0 6-Pin | Cable length 12cm |
| P4 | Heater cartridge | JST PH 2.0 2-Pin |  |  |
| P8 | Thermistor | JST 1.25mm 2-Pin |  |  |
| P6 | Probe  | JST 1.25mm 5-Pin |  |  |
| P5 | Part cooling fan | JST 1.25mm 2-Pin |  |  |
| P7 | Filament sensor | JST 1.25mm 3-Pin |  |  |

### Filament Sensor

I tested two random filament runout sensors that I had on hand. Both work just fine. It seems to me that any sensor with `VCC`, `Ground`, and `Signal` pins should work.

In order to get the filament sensor working, just make sure that the `VCC`, `Ground`, and `Signal` line up with the pins on the hotend PCB, port `P7`.

In order to 'mount' the sensor while it's not in use, simply glue a small magnet onto the sensor. You can then stick the sensor onto the extruder motor. You might also want to tether the sensor to the extruder cable with a piece of string.

Klipper filament configuration section:
```
[filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor]
switch_pin: !PA4 # "Pulled-high"
pause_on_runout: True
insert_gcode:
    M117 Insert Detected
runout_gcode:
    M117 Runout Detected
```

The complete Klipper code to make this work is part of my [OSS Klipper Configuration](https://github.com/bassamanator/Sovol-SV06-firmware).

#### Aftermarket Options

These can be found for very cheap (roughly $1.5) on Aliexpress and quite a bit more on  Amazon (though still very affordable). [This](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDLpdBX) is the one I bought. Here's another seemingly [viable option](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDPNmDX).

#### How To Cable

You need to make your own cable. I recommend getting these [JST 1.25 cables](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDORZ0D), and this [XH2.54 kit](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlejPpj). You will also need a crimping tool such as the [Engineer PA-09](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B002AVVO7K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
### Heatblock

<img src="./images/heatblock/heatblock-display.jpg" height="100" alt='Heatblock image'/>

The SV06 uses a Creality CR10 heatblock which supports MK8 threaded nozzles (including some M6 nozzles). The material is likely nickel-plated copper (*needs verification*).

The heatblock is mounted onto the extruder assembly using 2 x M2.5 10mm [SHCS](./images/shcs.png).

Please see some more relevant details [here](heatblock.md).

#### Aftermarket Options

*Coming soon.*

### Heater Cartridge

The SV06 uses a ceramic heater cartridge.

| Voltage | Watts | Dimensions | Connection | Cable Length |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 24V | 40W | 6x20mm | JST PH 2.0 2-Pin | ~40mm |

The heater cartridge is glued into the heatblock, a heatblock that heats to 300C. Although possible, it is unadvisable, and potentially dangerous to attempt removal. 

#### Aftermarket Options

The Ender 3 S1 Pro heater cartridge seem to be plug and play for it, including the connector. Pending testing, but it does look and measure the same.

~~Unfortunately, a direct, non-DIY replacement seems unlikely. It appears that no one sells heater cartridges with JST PH 2.0 2-Pin connectors.~~

~~You would have to buy a heater cartridge such as [this](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeKbxqv), and crimp the appropriate connector on. ~~

~~⚠️ Caveat: This is not an ordinary crimp job. The hotend assembly consumes a lot of power and is dangerously hot. Take every precaution.~~

### Thermistor

The SV06 uses a glass-bead thermistor.

| Material | Dimensions | Connection | Cable Length |
| - | - | - | - |
| Glass | 2mm | JST 1.25mm 2-Pin | ~40mm |

As was the case with the heater cartridge, the thermistor is also glued into place, and is very unlikely to survive removal given the delicacy of the cables and composing material.

#### Aftermarket Options

It also seems like it can use the thermistor for the Ender 3 S1 Pro.

### Heatbreak

| Cooper Portion | Overall Length | Outer Dia. | Inner Dia. |
| - | - | - | - |
| 15mm | 22mm | 7mm| 2mm|

<img src="./images/heatbreak/overall.jpg" width="100" alt='22mm'/>
<img src="./images/heatbreak/od.jpg" width="100" alt='Heatbreak spec'/>

#### Aftermarket Options

I purchased and tested [this heatbreak](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmzWJNb). It works as well as the stock piece.

*The part sold in the link could change, so make sure it has the following specs*:

### Probe

<img src="./images/probe/probe.png" height="600" alt='probe'/>

#### Aftermarket Options

I bought [this probe: LJ12A3-4-Z-BY](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCbT0mD). It's dimensionally correct, however, *completely untested*!
